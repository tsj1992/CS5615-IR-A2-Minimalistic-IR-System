# CS5615-IR-A2-Minimalistic-IR-System

This repository is used to develop an implementation of minimalistic information retrieval system using available software tools for an assignment for the module of Information Retrieval in M.Sc in Data Science, Analytics and Engineering, University of Moratuwa. - Author - KATS JAYATHILAKA

There are two projects created by Intellij IDEA. Simple application run configuration is enough to run the project files.

### SimpleWebCrawler

This is an implementation of Crawler4j modified to crawl a specified website to give an XML file as the output containing the site titles in the visited order.

### JASSjrImpl

This is an implementation of JASSjr; a Minimalist IR System to process the xml outputs generated by the previous project to create an inverted index and then do query searches. This is extended with two more features. They are,

1. Stopword removal
   - Stopwords specified by NLTK is stored in english_stop_words.txt in the project directory.
2. Porter Stemmer
   - SimpleStemmer - created by me which applies only a few of the steps in porter stemming algorithm
   - PorterStemmer - imported from an external library name [link lucene-snowball](http://www.java2s.com/Code/JarDownload/lucene-snowball/).
